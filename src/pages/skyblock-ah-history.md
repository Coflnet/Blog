## We made a new landing page
It was long overdue. Since we never really had a landing page this might as well be called 'finally a landing page'.
Just redirecting to `Aspect of the End` was pretty confusing for some users.
So we set out to change this.  
The new site is displayed when you visit [the Skyblock AH History](https://sky.coflnet.com).

It features a lot of things you can click on, including.
* Recently ended auctions
* Recently created auctions
* Popular/Trending searches 
* Recently updated players
* Recently found items
* the flipper preview
* and (for now) a link to this blog post

As everything on the site this is subject to change.  
Just like our naming just changed.
Turns out `Hypixel Skyblock Auction House History tracker` is hard to say in one breath.
The new name we go by is `Skyblock AH History` or just `AH history`. 
Wich is way easier to both pronounce and write.


## The Hypixel Network is down
> We made sure any time-based services on the network are taken care of. This means pausing boosters, pausing the SkyBlock Auction House and Bazaar timers, pausing timers on MVP++ and daily rewards, etc.

While writing this hypixel conducts maintinance to its servers. Since our [premium plan](https://sky.coflnet.com/premium) isn't of much use when there are no new auctions, we are extending the subscriptions of our premium users for as long as this maintinance will last/lasted.

## Feature of the day
Drummroll please:  
...  
#### Search without visiting the site.
While a fast autocomplete search bar is nice, first visiting the main page just to enter a search term is a hassle.
And frankly its not only a hassle it is also completely unecessary to do so.  
You can utilize the url to trigger a search.  
For example say you want to get to `Jerry-chine Gun` you can just type in the url
[sky.coflnet.com/i/jerry-c](https://sky.coflnet.com/i/jerry-) hit `enter` and our autocomomplete will do the rest for you.  
Please note that opening a page via `/i/` always chooses the first search result that you would get on the website.
The order of wich can change and is ranked by how often a given item or player is searched for. 
Currently [sky.coflnet.com/p/t](https://sky.coflnet.com/p/t) will lead you to `Technoblade` but this might not be the case in a few weeks/months.
So don't get confused when you end up on another page then you thought you would.
